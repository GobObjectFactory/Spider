- prefer composite moves that create a free cell, particularly after a deal
- prefer last resort moves that lead to a discard
- optimize scoring factors using designed experiments
- before playing onto a free cell search for a free cell preserving sequence

- prefer holding moves that match suit

- swaps could use holding piles from to the to pile
- if holding pile targets the offload, convert it to inverting
- if there are enough free cells to offload a run to a single pile pre-emptively call it inverting
- rename invertsPile to canInvert
- also consider moving the offload back onto the from pile
- when adding to the offload pile suits may be one less than the sum
- clean up diagnostics
- convert holding list to use supplementary list instead
- improve scoring of offload moves
- consider enumerating all offload moves instead of one per pile
- convert lower stack into yet another root
- permit inner run to be the offload
- count homeless runs allowing them as long as free cells permit
- no homeless at the end makes an emptying move
- no homeless anywhere else makes a free-cell preserving move
- one homeless at the end makes a free-cell perserving move
- use SupplementaryMoves instead of local list moves
- intermediate offload runs could use holding piles as well
- for offload consider trying to find homes for homeless runs by moving piles

- convert last resort scoring to new model

- add basic unit tests
- add holding unit tests

- inverted offload moves don't need to move the entire lower run to a free cell if the suits match
- offload moves no longer need the offload pile or offload index information

- prefer long exposed runs even if it means splitting a run

- figure out why simple consistently gets better results than complex
- theory: prefer to have a single run on a free cell
- calculate oneRunDelta correctly for swaps
- check whether moves with oneRunDelta > 0 are rejected
