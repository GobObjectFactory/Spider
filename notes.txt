- consider multiple moves when preferring to expose a useful card when forced to play onto free cells
- prefer composite moves that create a free cell, particularly after a deal
- prefer last resort moves that lead to a discard
- optimize scoring factors using designed experiments
- support finding buried multi-suit sequences
- assess multi move sequences like regular moves
- add asserts for buried inner runs
- make console access threadsafe
- before playing onto a free cell search for a free cell preserving sequence
- extend buried sequences to multiple upper runs
- try removing infinite score for last resort moves because buried should have found it

- make simple the default
