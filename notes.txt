- undo holding piles if it increases the order
- try to reuse TryToAddOneRunMove for CheckOffload

- promote one run delta to a full-fledged scoring feature
- consider length of to pile down count when scoring

- review space calculations when counting uses
- could use holding piles for uncovering moves
- could collect composite uncovering moves
- rename test jig
- retest complex
- merge the multiple different places that space algorithms are implemented
- upgrade to full power of two extra suits algorithm
- convert holding list to use supplementary list instead
- improve scoring of offload moves
- consider enumerating all offload moves instead of one per pile
- for offload consider trying to find homes for homeless runs by uncovering targets

- optimize scoring factors using designed experiments
- before playing onto an space search for an space preserving sequence

- prefer holding moves that match suit

- prefer long exposed runs even if it means splitting a run, just before a deal

- figure out why simple consistently gets better results than complex
- theory: prefer to have a single run on an space
- calculate oneRunDelta correctly for swaps
- check whether moves with oneRunDelta > 0 are rejected

- alternate Nelder-Mead implementation:
