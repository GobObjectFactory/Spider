- consider multiple moves when preferring to expose a useful card when forced to play onto free cells
- prefer composite moves that create a free cell, particularly after a deal
- break down composite moves when actually executing the move
- prefer last resort moves that lead to a discard
- optimize scoring factors using designed experiments
- validate pile indexes, etc.
- ensure last resort moves are scored less than all other moves
- verify extra suits when moving to a free cell
- make sure swaps where the from pile is at the root work
- fix extra suits calculation for moving to a free cell
- support finding buried multi-suit sequences
- assess multi move sequences like regular moves
- add asserts for buried inner runs
- take holding pile into account for buried moves
- emphasize last resort moves that turns over a new card
- make console access threadsafe
- review rejection of whole pile swaps
- check whether the new swap changes make CheckWholePileSwaps redundant
- review scoring of all swaps
- fix holding pile suits if not at a boundary
- support cascading holding piles
