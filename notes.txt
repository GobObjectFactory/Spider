- prefer composite moves that create a free cell, particularly after a deal
- prefer last resort moves that lead to a discard
- optimize scoring factors using designed experiments
- make console access threadsafe
- before playing onto a free cell search for a free cell preserving sequence

- make simple the default

- support multi-root buried moves with from as a target
- improve scoring of buried moves
- consider enumerating all buried moves instead of one per stack
- rename buried to offload

- add compact game serialization
- add unit tests

- inverted offload moves don't need to move the entire lower run to a free cell if the suits match
- offload moves no longer need the offload pile or offload index information
